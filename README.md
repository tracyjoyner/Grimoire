# Backend developemnt using Mongo DB - My Old Grimoire

# Scenario:
You’ve been a freelance back-end developer in the Paris area for a year now. You’ve been working with Kevin, a front-end developer with more experience than you, who already has a good network of contacts in the industry. 

Kevin gets in touch with you with an opportunity to work together, combining his front-end and your back-end skills on a brand new project. It’s for a small chain of bookstores that wants to launch a book listing and rating website. 

Here’s the email you receive from him:

Subject: Development of a Book Rating Website

Hello!

I hope you’re doing well. I’ve got a new project for you, from a client who wants to launch a book rating website for their chain of “Le Vieux Grimoire” bookstores in Paris. The website will be called “Mon Vieux Grimoire” and will let members add a new book along with a rating that is visible to the public.

We’ve already been in discussion with the client for a few weeks, and we’ve prepared the functional specifications for the first version of the site. I’ve also asked a designer I’ve worked with before to come up with the mock-up. It’s all attached to this email.

I’ll be doing the developing of the website’s front-end in React. So, I need a back-end developer, and that’s where you come in!

Would you be interested in doing the back-end in this project?

If so, I’ll get back to you at the end of the month once the front-end has been completed. I’ll also provide more detail on the API that will need to be implemented.

If you have any questions, feel free to get back to me. 

Have a great day!

Kevin,

Hi,

I’ve finished the front-end of the website! Everything is available on GitHub. I’ve also prepared the technical specifications document for the API, which will also serve as the project specifications for the back-end development. Please make sure that the entire website is working properly. The front-end should be ready to connect to your API.

When you’ve finished, it would be a good idea to have a meeting so that you can show me your code, and we can check that the application is working properly. Then, I can send it all to the client and present them with the finished website.

“I almost forgot!

To be sure that the project complies with Green Code best practices, we need to think about the image size.
Images sent by users need to be optimized in the back-end. There will be lots of them.

Thanks and have a great day!”
